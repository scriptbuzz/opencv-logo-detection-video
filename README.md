# opencv-logo-detection

Companies are keen on monitoring how their logos are presented on the internet for various reasons including impact of marketing campaigns, trademark infringement, consumer sentiments, etc. 

Logo detection pipelines typically include various stages from crawling the web for relevant images, acquiring and storing images, converting and standardizing image formats, capturing image metadata, etc. Regardless of the pipeline workflow, at some point, an image of interest will be analyzed for the presence of the company logo. 

Most logos in images are not ideally positioned. Logos can be warped, cropped, reduced quality, partially obstructed, improperly color-corrected, etc. These challenges need to be addressed by the image processing tools to be effective in identifying the presence of a logo in an image.
