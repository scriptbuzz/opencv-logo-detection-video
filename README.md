OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision software library. OpenCV containes algorithms to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, etc. https://opencv.org

Companies are keen on monitoring how their logos are presented on the internet for various reasons including impact of marketing campaigns, trademark infringement, consumer sentiments, etc. 

Logo detection pipelines typically include various stages from crawling the web for relevant images, acquiring and storing images, converting and standardizing image formats, capturing image metadata, etc. Regardless of the pipeline workflow, at some point, an image of interest will be analyzed for the presence of the company logo. 

Mostlogos in images are not ideally positioned. Logos can be warped, cropped, reduced quality, partially obstructed, improperly color-corrected, etc. These challenges need to be addressed by the image processing tools to be effective in identifying the presence of a logo in an image. 

This video demosntrates capabilties of OpenCV in logo detection in support of a customer prototype using a Jupyter notebook for demo purposes:
